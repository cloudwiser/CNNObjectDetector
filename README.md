#### recog : a quick intro

##### Pre-requsiite : OpenCV

Please install 4.0.0 ideally or, if not available, v3.4.3+ as older versions will throw a CNN model exceptions given there is no cv.dnn functionality supported

```sh
$ pip install opencv-python
```

If you are running without the need or access to an X server, there is the (lighter-weight) headless python package which can be installed:

```sh
$ pip install opencv-python-headless
```

##### Pre-requisite : model weight files

Each model requires a weights file to go with the pbtext or cfg file that describes the model architecture. Alas these weights files are huge to the point of exceeding the GitHub file upload limit so are not included here.

So...please take a look at the top of recog_argparse.py for the names of the relevant files to Google for...and I'll add links to the necessary files for SSD Mobilenet v1 & v2 and YOLO v3 models here

Once you have the weights file, place it in the relevant 'model' sub-directory and use the path & name with the --weights argument as shown in the next section

##### Usage 

Run `python3 recog.py --help` for the full list of arguments which should be fairly self-explanatory.

The mandatory arguments are the `model` which defines which one should be used, `classes` which is the path to the text file contatining the list of objects the model was trained to recognise, `graph` which is the path to the text file defining the model architecture and `weights` which is the binary file containing the weights for the model. Note this latter file is not included and needs to be downloaded to your local `./models/...` directory (see above)

```sh
$ python3 recog.py --stream='http://192.168.0.1/video.cgi' --classes='./models/yolo3/yolo3.classes' --weights='./models/yolo3/yolo3.weights' --graph='./models/yolo3/yolo3.cfg' --model='yolo3'
$ python3 recog.py --video=people.mp4  --classes='<path>'  --weights='<path>'  --graph='<path>' --model='<ssd1, ssd2 or yolo3>'
$ python3 recog.py                     --classes='<path>'  --weights='<path>'  --graph='<path>' --model='<ssd1, ssd2 or yolo3>'
(no input source argument = use your local webcam as video source)
```

##### Sample video : licence-free content for testing and threshold-tuning

If you require a sample video file of people objects aka persons to tune or test or simply experiment with, see the link below. 
The Pexel site also has other royalty-free content that may be relevant

##### Headless OpenCV install on AWS Linux

The one-free-micro-instance-per-month on AWS is a nice bargain and I have configured a micro EC2 instance to run 2 instances of recog handling 2 separate RTSP video streams. Inference processing time will depend on model, stream resolution and number of recog instances obviously.

It requires some additional pre-requisites to be installed in order to first build OpenCV 4 as below and, assuming you are running this without X as the output, you can also install the headless version of the OpenCV python package.

Remember to add the `--headless` argument to the recog.py command line otherwise the script will error.

```sh
$ sudo yum update
$ sudo yum install git cmake gcc-c++ cmake3
$ git clone https://github.com/Itseez/opencv.git
$ cd opencv
$ mkdir ./build
$ git checkout
$ cd ./build
$ cmake3 ../
$ sudo yum install numpy python-devel pip
$ sudo pip install opencv-python
$ pip install opencv-python-headless --user
$ pip install supervisor
```
The `supervisor` install is not mandatory but is is a great solution to running detached python-based processs on Linux.
Important if you are wanting to run continously and unattended as these processes may go zombie once you logout or close your ssh session into the EC2 instance.

See http://supervisord.org/introduction.html for more info on what is an amazingly feature-rich package.


##### Image upload via recog_uploader

This is a simple FTP uploader script that monitors a local directory and copies or moves image files generated by `recog.py --out='<path>'` to a remote directory hosted on a FTP server.

See `python3 recog_uploader.py --help` for the set of arguments available and, in the case of `host`, `username` and `password` required.

At the time of writing, the script doesn't support anonymous FTP login nor check for the presence of previously uploaded image files. Another couple of TODO's...or pull request ;-)


##### Pull requests

Always welcome :-)


##### Background reading

Given the continual research and application of CNN-based models to vision processing, there are a ton of articles on Medium and elsewhere that details the model architecture, performance (mAP accuracy vs inference speed), training as well as (for some) usage with OpenCV as we are doing here. A couple of relevant on the OpenCV aspects that might help if you are wanting to dive deeper...

##### TensorFlow graph file creation

You shouldn't need to recreate the pbtxt (graph) file but future changes in either Tensorflow and/or OpenCV dnn might necessitate it. Equally, if you decide to deploy a modified graph following re-training, the command line from the TF GH model repo is shown below...which I have not tested:

```sh
$ python tf_text_graph_faster_rcnn.py --input /path/to/model.pb --config /path/to/example.config --output /path/to/graph.pbtxt
```

Example:

```sh
$ python tf_text_graph_ssd.py --input ./ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29/frozen_inference_graph.pb --config ./ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco.config --output ./ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2019_01_28.pbtxt
```
